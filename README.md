# Terrarium engine

### About
* What is that? 
   * This is 2-d terraria-like engine which gives (well, will give in future) great API for modding.
* Is it playable?
   * For now is very much things to do to make THIS playable, like API, netcode, refactoring and optimization

### History
   * This game/engine (not decided yet) is VERY inspired by Minetest and (of course) Terraria
   * I have tried to make 2-d sandbox game before, but i failed every time. This is the best try

### Roadmap
   * For now, i'm planning to refactor the code and make basic modding API.
   * After that, i will try to make basic multiplayer to make game a little funnier
   * Later, i will try to rewrite engine code to C(++), Rust, or other language for better perfomance
