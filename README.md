# Terrarium engine

### About
* What is that? 
   * This is 2-d terraria-like engine which gives (well, will give in future) great API for modding.
* Is it playable?
   * For now is very much things to do to make THIS playable, like API, netcode, refactoring and optimization

### History
   * This game/engine (not decided yet) is VERY inspired by Minetest and (of course) Terraria
   * I have tried to make 2-d sandbox game before, but i failed every time. This is the best try
